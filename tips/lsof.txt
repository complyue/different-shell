To show all networking related to a given port:

lsof -iTCP -i :port
lsof -i :22
To show connections to a specific host, use @host

lsof -i@192.168.1.5
Show connections based on the host and the port using @host:port lsof -i@192.168.1.5:22

grepping for LISTEN shows what ports your system is waiting for connections on:

lsof -i| grep LISTEN
Show what a given user has open using -u:

lsof -u daniel
See what files and network connections a command is using with -c

lsof -c syslog-ng
The -p switch lets you see what a given process ID has open, which is good for learning more about unknown processes:

lsof -p 10075
The -t option returns just a PID

lsof -t -c Mail
Using the -t and -c options together you can HUP processes

kill -HUP $(lsof -t -c sshd)
You can also use the -t with -u to kill everything a user has open

kill -9 $(lsof -t -u daniel)
